st.title("Comparative Analysis of Fund Performance")
st.markdown("""
The objective of this chapter is to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of five leading ELSS mutual funds in India over the period 2020–2024. 
By examining the interplay of NAV growth, Assets Under Management (AUM) dynamics, and multi-period return performances, 
this chapter seeks to unveil critical insights into fund strategies, management efficiency, and investor behavior patterns. 
Rather than treating performance metrics in isolation, a cross-linked approach is adopted to demonstrate how various factors—such as fund size, risk-taking ability, and sectoral exposure—collectively influence investor outcomes.
